## Description
SCoTED is developed by members of the "Institute of Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Building (e3D), RWTH Aachen University" using Python 3.9. It is based on [Koschwitz 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311304412_Softwaregestutzte_Warmebedarfsermittlung_bei_Informations-_und_Ressourcenknappheit) and was further developed in the research project [GeTIS](https://www.enargus.de/pub/bscw.cgi/?op=enargus.eps2&q=GeTis&v=10&id=365838) and [GeoWaermeWende](https://www.enargus.de/pub/bscw.cgi/?op=enargus.eps2&q=GeoWaermeWende&v=10&id=10567045). It provides a high-performance, easy-to-use, analytical approach to generate heating load curves based on annual consumption or standard heating loads.


## Installation
SCoTED can be used by cloning or downloading the whole disteLCA package from the GIT Repository.
